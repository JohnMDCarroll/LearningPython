'''
Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.
(For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.).
You can (and should!) use your answer to Exercise 4 to help you.
Take this opportunity to practice using functions, described below.

num = int(input('Insert a number: '))

if num > 1:
    # check for factors
    for i in range(2, num):
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(num, "is not a prime number")
            print(i, "times", num // i, "is", num)
            break
    else:
        print(num, "is a prime number")

# if input number is less than
# or equal to 1, it is not prime
else:
    print(num, "is not a prime number")
